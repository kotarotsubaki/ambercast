"""Stop hook: keep the /implement flow moving while steps remain.

The orchestrating agent handles background-task completion notifications
(e.g. Codex delegations) as ordinary turns; without a gate it may end the
turn right there and the 17-step flow stalls until a human nudges it.
While the current branch's state file has incomplete steps, this hook
answers the Stop event with {"decision": "block"} and names the next step,
re-anchoring the agent to the flow.

Scope and escape hatches:
- fires only when the current branch matches issues/<N> or issues/<N>-<slug>
  AND .claude/impl/issue-<N>.state exists (grammar shared with guard_git.py
  and guard_phase.py); any other branch or a detached HEAD passes through
- a session with live background work (teammate, subagent, background shell;
  Stop input `background_tasks`, v2.1.145+) may stop. Completion notifications
  can be lost while the host is suspended, so `watch_progress.py` is the
  independent watchdog backstop that eventually re-wakes an idle lead. This
  still keeps orchestrator sessions that share the branch with an implementing
  teammate from being blocked into implementing that teammate's job itself.
- `paused=true` in the state file -> allow the stop and reset the stall
  counter (intentional pause; remove the line to resume with a fresh budget)
- stall protection: .claude/impl/.guard-stop-issue-<N>.json records a
  progress digest; after MAX_STALLED_BLOCKS consecutive blocks with no
  progress the stop is allowed until progress resumes. The digest covers
  everything a working flow touches — state, todos, plan, review verdicts,
  implementation logs, and the git working tree — so only a genuinely stuck
  agent exhausts the budget. It counts only PROGRESS_ARTIFACT_SUFFIXES in the
  review and log directories, because a delegated agent's transcript is
  streamed into the review directory by the caller and would otherwise make
  every blocked turn look like progress (#210). The counter is scoped to the
  session id and persisted atomically, failing open (allow the stop) when it
  cannot be recorded.
- absolute ceiling: the same sidecar records MAX_TOTAL_BLOCKS worth of blocks
  that no amount of progress resets, so a defect in progress detection can no
  longer remove the bound. Claude Code's own consecutive-block cap
  (CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP, default 8) is an additional outer backstop
  there; Codex CLI has none, which is why this ceiling lives in the guard.
- kill switch: AMBERCAST_GUARD_STOP=0 disables the hook entirely

Branch evidence deliberately distinguishes detached state from unavailable policy
evidence. The shared Claude boundary remains fail-open, while the Codex adapter
observes policy probes and terminates safely when evidence is ambiguous. Evidence
required to establish repository progress cannot be empty.
