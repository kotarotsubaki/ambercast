/**
 * Supplies dependency-cruiser's ESM rule set by translating every role in
 * `LAYERS` from tools/architecture-policy.mjs. This avoids a second,
 * independently maintained boundary matrix. Every role receives an internal
 * default-deny rule derived from `mayImport`; `adapters-http` receives the
 * same treatment from the adapters carve-out. Generated rules are named
 * `<role>-boundary`, except where an existing stable identifier names the
 * generated core, standard-adapter, or CLI boundary. The remaining stable
 * specialized rules have disjoint target sets, so one dependency produces one
 * actionable diagnostic rather than overlapping reports.
 *
 * The configuration sets `options.tsPreCompilationDeps` to
 * `"specify"` once, alongside the repository `tsconfig.json`. That option
 * makes pre-compilation dependency information available; it does not permit
 * type imports on its own. Each types-only table edge instead has a forbidden
 * rule with `to.preCompilationOnly: false`, which fires for a value edge and
 * leaves a pre-compilation-only type edge exempt. Those qualified edges are
 * `ports` -> `core`, `usecases` -> `ports`, `report` -> `core`, and
 * `config` -> `ports`.
 *
 * Dependency-cruiser forbids `config` -> `ports` value imports and allows
 * type-only imports. Its available path and dependency-type conditions do not
 * provide symbol-level resolution, so the type-only exemption cannot be
 * restricted to the `Storage` type; this intentionally coarser approximation
 * is the configuration's stable contract.
 *
 * The standard adapter path excludes HTTP, while the HTTP carve-out has its
 * own runtime-consumer boundary. Runtime permits the standard adapter path
 * only, and its dedicated HTTP target rule prevents the opposite half of a
 * cycle. The standard adapter's captured family permits only its matching
 * port-module file; a shared ports index is not an allowance. A flat file at
 * the adapters root cannot represent a family and is therefore subject to a
 * separate no-import rule; this conservative fallback prevents a filename
 * from being used as a fictitious family capture.
 *
 * External allow-lists are also compiled from each role. An approved builtin
 * must resolve with dependency type `core`; an approved package must resolve
 * below its approved `node_modules` root with an npm dependency type.
 * Unresolved dependencies, including fake builtin-looking subpaths, and every
 * other resolved external dependency are forbidden. This relies on
 * dependency-cruiser's resolution facts rather than specifier regexes.
 *
 * The stable rule identifiers are `core-is-leaf`,
 * `core-external-allowlist`, `usecases-no-concrete-adapters`,
 * `cli-must-go-through-runtime`, `adapters-no-sibling-reachover`,
 * `adapters-http-runtime-only`, `ports-core-types-only`,
 * `usecases-ports-types-only`, `report-core-types-only`,
 * `config-ports-types-only`, and `check-no-write-capable-dependencies`.
 * Fixture tests assert these alongside generated boundary names, so changing
 * either convention is an intentional contract change.
 *
 * The check-specific rule uses reachability because its purpose is to
 * keep write-capable dependencies out of the whole check closure, not merely
 * to reject direct imports. Its system-adapter targets remain individual:
 * check-command legitimately needs the clock and configuration-environment
 * adapters in that shared family, so forbidding all of `adapters/system/**`
 * would overreach the read-only capability boundary.
