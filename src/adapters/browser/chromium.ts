/*
 * Adapts Chromium through the browser ports while keeping Playwright an
 * implementation detail. No Playwright type crosses this module's public
 * surface or the `src/ports/browser.ts` boundary; callers receive only the
 * serializable values and port contracts they need to orchestrate a run.
 *
 * A structural `PlaywrightLauncher` seam spans the browser, context, and page
 * lifecycle. This follows the whole-lifecycle injection pattern of
 * `CommandRunner` in the AI adapters: a page-methods-only fake would leave
 * launch options, context creation, and cleanup unexercised. The complete seam
 * lets unit tests drive that sequence without starting a browser.
 *
 * Ordinary element operations retain Locator semantics after binding has
 * rechecked the session-private record, navigation generation, and
 * accessibility fingerprint. Secret writes need a stronger boundary because
 * a late Locator resolution could otherwise select a same-named element in a
 * document reached after the sink-origin decision. The secret path strictly
 * acquires one adapter-private physical element after continuity, rejects a
 * navigation-generation change caused during acquisition, and makes
 * the final live-origin decision immediately before filling that same object.
 * Each call owns and releases its physical element independently. Reusing one
 * would bypass that later call's continuity, generation, and origin checks and
 * could retain an element from a document the session has already left.
 * Cleanup failures cannot replace either a primary rejection or a successful
 * fill. This closes cross-document retargeting while accepting only the
 * narrower renderer-internal interval after the pinned operation is accepted.
