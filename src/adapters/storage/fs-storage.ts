/**
 * Replaces a filesystem path with atomic visibility after its payload has
 * been written to a temporary sibling.
 *
 * @param path - Target path whose readers observe either its complete
 * previous content or its complete replacement content.
 * @param write - Writes one caller-specific payload to the supplied temporary
 * path.
 * @returns Resolves after the complete temporary file has replaced `path`.
 * @throws Rethrows the original error reported by the temporary write or
 * replacement.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Callers prepare the target's parent with `ensureParentDirectory` before
 * invoking this helper. A fixed-length, target-basename-independent temporary
 * name avoids exceeding a filesystem component-length limit. Keeping the
 * temporary file in the target directory preserves the same-volume assumption
 * that makes replacement by `rename` atomic.
 *
 * Exclusive creation and fresh-name retries turn concurrent temporary-name
 * collisions into an explicit error rather than overwriting another writer's
 * artifact. Replacement does not use an unlink-then-create gap that could
 * expose partial content.
 *
 * Best-effort cleanup never conceals the original write or replacement error.
 * This protects only operation-reported failures: abrupt process termination
 * can leave an artifact behind. Replacement deliberately has rename semantics,
 * so it does not preserve the overwritten path's inode, permissions,
 * ownership, ACLs, or symlink-following behavior; `StorageAdapter` does not
 * guarantee those properties.

 *
 * @remarks
 * Text operations use UTF-8, while binary operations pass bytes
 * through without text encoding. Both write forms prepare missing parent
 * directories before writing, preserving the port's convenience contract
 * without forcing callers to sequence directory creation themselves. Their
 * shared atomic-write helper stages a complete payload before making it
 * visible at the target path.
 *
 * The existence probe returns `false` for every inspection
 * failure, including missing paths, directories, and operating-system errors,
 * so callers can use it safely during discovery. Direct-file listings are
 * non-recursive, contain only lexicographically sorted bare regular-file
 * names, and yield `[]` for empty or missing directories. Directory creation
 * is idempotent, including the port's empty-string root directory.
