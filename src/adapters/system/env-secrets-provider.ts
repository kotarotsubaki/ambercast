 * @returns A provider that resolves `{{secrets.a.b}}` through
 * `AMBERCAST_SECRET_A_B`: it replaces dots with underscores and uppercases
 * the reference segments.
 *
 * @remarks
 * With no override, the provider reads `process.env` at the real system
 * boundary. That is intentionally not described as hermetic: the process
 * environment is ambient mutable state. The override exists so a unit test
 * can supply a fixed record without mutating that state; production
 * composition leaves it absent.
