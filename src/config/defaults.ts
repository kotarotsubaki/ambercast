 * default selection rather than an empty placeholder for a later layer to
 * repair.
 *
 * `testDir` and `runsDir` intentionally remain relative here even though the
 * ResolvedConfig contract carries absolute paths. The distinction is
 * an invariant of the loader, not of TypeScript's string type: loadConfig
 * alone anchors these opaque path strings to the selected config file or its
 * caller's directory, just as StorageAdapter leaves path interpretation to
 * its caller. `projectRoot` has no static relative default because loading
 * derives it from the caller directory or selected configuration file, so this
 * template purposefully omits it rather than supply a value that cannot be
 * meaningful before loading.
