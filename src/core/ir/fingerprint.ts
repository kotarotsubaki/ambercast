 * Computes the versioned accessibility-neighborhood fingerprint for an

 * @param ref - The accessibility role and name that identify the target node.
 * @param resolvedSecretValues - Resolved secret-value sets. Only their values
 *   matter at this core boundary, so callers pass a values iterator without
 *   exposing secret-reference keys.
 * @returns An `ok` result with the fingerprint, `no-match` for malformed,
 *   absent, or unhashable evidence, `ambiguous-match` for duplicate locator
 *   candidates, `snapshot-invalid` for evidence rejected by the ARIA parser,
 *   or `secret-contaminated` when descriptor data contains a resolved secret.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The algorithm accepts exactly one normalized role-and-name match. It hashes
 * that node's order-preserving descriptor through `toCanonicalDigestBytes`
 * from `./canonical-json.js`, which emits compact canonical JSON encoded as
 * UTF-8 bytes. SHA-256 hashes those exact bytes; its lowercase hexadecimal
 * digest is recorded with the {@link FINGERPRINT_ALGORITHM} algorithm tag.
 * The descriptor includes normalized identities for the target, its parent,
 * and its immediately adjacent siblings; a first or last child records the
 * missing neighbor as `null`. The synthetic root contributes as the parent of
 * top-level page nodes but is never a match candidate itself.
 *
 * The classification keeps absence and ambiguity distinct. A full
 * neighborhood hash never chooses among duplicate role-and-name matches:
 * downstream role-and-name locators cannot retain which physical duplicate was
 * fingerprinted, so treating one duplicate as a confirmed target is unsound.
 *
 * Malformed values are ordinary non-matches rather than hashing errors. When
 * the hashing step catches the specific `RangeError` from
 * `toCanonicalDigestBytes` for an unpaired UTF-16 surrogate in a role or name
 * string, it returns `no-match`: that identity cannot be canonically hashed
 * and is an ordinary no-confident-fingerprint outcome, not a hashing error.
 * This catch provides a non-throwing outcome specifically for that documented
 * unpaired-surrogate case; other unexpected canonicalization or hashing
 * errors still propagate.
 *
 * Before hashing a unique descriptor, the function rejects resolved secrets
 * in its eight role/name fields. Role fields compare against raw secret text,
 * while name fields compare against each secret normalized by
 * {@link normalizeName}; this symmetry checks exactly the text that is
 * hashed and closes Unicode-composition and whitespace-normalization gaps.
 * Empty resolved-secret values are always skipped and never taint a
 * descriptor. Every nonempty exact match taints regardless of its length. A
 * substring match taints only when the secret comparison value has at least
 * three UTF-16 code units: the raw secret for a role field and the normalized
 * secret for a name field. The length threshold is therefore measured on the
 * same string used in that field's comparison, never on its unnormalized
 * counterpart.
 *
 * `resolvedSecretValues` may be a single-use iterable such as `Map.values()`.
 * The implementation must consume that iterable in exactly one pass,
 * materializing it once before checking multiple descriptor fields rather
 * than starting a new iteration for each field and missing later taint checks.

 * This function shares the same exact-role, normalized-name matching and

 * nodes always produce `ambiguous-match`, even when one candidate happens to
 * hash to `expected`.
 * A plain role-and-name browser locator can select a different duplicate from
 * the candidate whose neighborhood matched, so no hash can make that outcome
 * safe to honor. A malformed tree remains an ordinary `element-not-found`
 * result, while the parser's dedicated invalid marker remains distinct so
 * callers can explain that the captured evidence itself was untrusted.
 * If hashing catches the specific `RangeError` from
 * `toCanonicalDigestBytes` for an unpaired UTF-16 surrogate in a role or name
 * string, this function likewise returns `element-not-found`: that identity
 * cannot be canonically hashed and is an ordinary non-match, not a hashing
 * error. This catch provides an ordinary `element-not-found` result
 * specifically for that documented unpaired-surrogate case; other unexpected
 * canonicalization or hashing errors still propagate.
 *
 * This verification path intentionally has no resolved-secret parameter.
 * Secret taint guards fingerprint generation before a value can enter the
 * cache. Algorithm versioning rejects incompatible grounding documents before
 * live verification, so resolution receives fingerprints produced under the
 * same cache policy.
