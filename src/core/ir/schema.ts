 * every response reaching it already passed the transport boundary above —
 * and it independently widens each intent's `assertion` to `JsonValue`
 * rather than reusing that boundary's stricter element shape, keeping this
 * contract self-sufficient instead of assuming an AJV pass already happened.
 * The specific `success-criterion-missing` and `intent-id-missing`
 * diagnostics for an admitted empty array are reported afterward, by
