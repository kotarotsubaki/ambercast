 * @remarks
 * An explicit caller choice is authoritative. A missing requested own name
 * fails without falling back to the configured default or an implicit
 * candidate. Without an explicit choice, the loader-validated default has
 * precedence; otherwise the configured targets must supply one unambiguous
 * enumerable own candidate. Only `undefined` denotes absence, so an empty
 * string remains a valid target name through every selection route.
 *
 * Named authority is restricted to own properties, while implicit candidates
 * are restricted to enumerable own properties. Inherited prototype names
 * therefore cannot become configured authority by lookup accident. Stable
 * candidate ordering makes ambiguity diagnostics deterministic. The two
 * failure forms distinguish a missing requested name from an unresolved
 * implicit choice and retain the relevant requested or candidate information.
 *
 * Failures are returned so generation and replay can retain their established
 * per-file classification and continue later files. Freshness inspection
 * throws the same classified value at its command-level selection boundary.
 * The shared `target-unresolved` kind maps to the public
 * `TARGET_UNRESOLVED` code and process exit 2.
 * In v4 replay, heal, and check use the verified Plan's complete Target set
 * through `projectPlanTargets`; this resolver remains the explicit generation
 * restriction and fallback policy only.
