 * navigation URLs and fill values, and resolves a `fill-secret` action's

 * fully materialized fields, while no resolved secret value crosses back over

 * rejects, and that rejection propagates through agentic execution's
 * transport/execution-error contract. It is not converted into
 * `outcome: 'failure'`, which describes a completed interaction that did not
 * reach its goal.
 *
 * Both controller methods enforce the current request's trusted secret and
 * run-reference grants before materializing provider-directed data. They
 * reject an integrity violation rather than allowing untrusted provider output
 * to direct the browser; adapters may handle their own transport retries but
 * must not turn that boundary failure into an in-band agentic outcome.
 *
 * The wrapper is the sole recorder of performed actions; adapters do not
 * report a second trace. A TypeScript type alone does not validate an action
 * or assertion received from an external provider process, so the
 * run-pipeline controller validates each against the exported
 * {@link TraceAction} or {@link TraceAssert} zod schema at controller entry.
