 * A lightweight, session-local continuity handle for a bound element.

 * `resolveGrounded` is the sole source of a `BoundElement`: it mints one only

 * matches the supplied {@link ElementRef} (and, in verify mode, that its
 * descriptor hashes to the expected {@link Fingerprint}). Every later
 * element-targeted operation accepts this handle instead of a bare
 * `ElementRef`, preserving session provenance, navigation generation, and
 * accessibility-fingerprint continuity rather than independently resolving a
 * locator at each call.
 *
 * The two fields are plain, serializable data — a `BoundElement` is safe to
 * log or include in a diagnostic without leaking anything beyond what the
 * plan and grounding cache already expose. That is deliberate: the
 * continuity checks this type represents do not live in these fields. They
 * live in adapter-private state, keyed by this object's identity, that
 * records which session minted it, at which navigation generation, and is
 * consulted — never these public fields — immediately before every operation
 * (see `perform`/`evaluateAssert`/`captureValue`). A caller that constructs a
 * look-alike `{ref, fingerprint}` object, or that passes a genuine
 * `BoundElement` to a different session instance than the one that minted
 * it, fails that private lookup and is rejected before any Playwright call.
 * At mint time, the adapter copies both `ref` and `fingerprint` into that
 * private record without sharing either value with this public object. A
 * caller's runtime mutation of either public value therefore cannot alter the
 * provenance, locator, or expected fingerprint that a later operation uses.
 *
 * A `BoundElement` is not a DOM node handle and cannot by itself prove
 * physical-node identity. Its checks narrow, rather than eliminate,
 * wrong-target risk: an in-place replacement by another node with the same
 * fingerprint before the next re-verification is indistinguishable. Ordinary
 * targeted operations may retain a residual interval after that check.
 * {@link BrowserSession.fillSecret} has the stronger portable contract of
 * fixing its write target before the final live-origin validation and never
 * resolving another target afterward. A real-browser adapter can satisfy that
 * contract with an implementation-private physical object; this public handle
 * neither requires nor exposes that mechanism.
 *
 * The handle is inherently session-local and short-lived: it is never
 * persisted (grounding stores an `ElementRef` and a `Fingerprint`, not this
 * type) and it is not meaningful once the session that minted it has
 * navigated away from the observation it was minted against or has closed.

   * never recompute it. Unlike ordinary targeted actions, every implementation
   * fixes the write target before the final live-origin validation and never

   * can satisfy this semantic guarantee by strictly acquiring a per-call
   * physical object after continuity and validating navigation around that
   * acquisition. Such mechanics remain implementation-private rather than
   * becoming part of `BoundElement` or this port.
   *
   * Implementations check the current page origin against the policy before
   * continuity work, when continuity, implementation-specific target fixing,
   * or post-fixing navigation validation rejects, and immediately before
   * filling the fixed target. The first checkpoint preserves the integrity
   * failure when a navigation changes both origin and generation. During the
   * reclassification region, the origin check replaces the original failure
   * only if the origin is now unsound; otherwise that failure propagates
   * unchanged.
   * A fully synchronous implementation whose continuity re-verification has no
   * asynchronous or callback boundary may omit the reclassification checkpoint:
   * no origin mutation can interleave for its catch to observe, so its pre-check
   * and final pre-fill check suffice. A synchronous fake whose model already
   * identifies one fixed target therefore conforms without introducing a
   * physical acquisition or disposal resource.
   * No target resolution or additional `await` may occur between the final
   * origin check and invoking the fill on the target already fixed. In a
   * real-browser adapter, a navigation that starts after invocation can detach
   * an acquired object and make the fill fail, but it cannot make the
   * implementation reacquire a matching element in the new document.
   *
   * Origin and `BoundElement` continuity are independent layers: the latter
   * remains the ordinary failure documented by {@link resolveGrounded}, while
   * a rejected origin propagates as an integrity violation. Unlike other
   * targeted port operations, every implementation uses the classified error
   * required below for this origin-specific path.
   *
   * An implementation that acquires a disposable physical target releases it
   * after every post-acquisition outcome. Cleanup failures never replace a
   * primary error and are also suppressed after success, keeping resource
   * cleanup from changing the operation's semantic result or exposing
   * browser-provided text. The final check and fixed-target operation close
