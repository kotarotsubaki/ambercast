/**
 * Composes dependencies for one configured command invocation.

 * @remarks
 * This is intentionally not a general ports factory. It serves the two real
 * callers, `generate` and `run`, and grows only with dependencies one of them
 * actually uses. Generation and replay both make `events` a real dependency;
 * command-specific random and environment adapters remain direct imports at
 * their consuming runtime boundary, following the established randomness
 * pattern instead of widening this shared composer. Keeping one composer
 * instead of a speculative `createRunAmbercast()` split preserves a single,
 * visibly Ports-aligned application boundary.
 *
 * `aiProvider` is optional because generation resolves provider policy at its
 * first real AI dispatch rather than while composing shared services.
 * Omitting it leaves `aiExecutor` absent from the result; `run-command.ts`
 * passes a fixed `aiProvider: 'claude'` literal for the shared composer shape.
 * That executor is not passed to `run()`—`RunDeps`
 * has no `aiExecutor` field—so a grounded replay still requires no AI CLI.
 *
 * `uiExecutor` and `secrets` remain optional in both input and result
 * because generation supplies neither. Replay keeps local, non-optional
 * references to the same values it passes here and gives those references
 * directly to `run()`'s non-optional `RunDeps` fields; it does not read them
 * back from the optional `Ambercast` properties and therefore needs no unsound
 * assertion. The returned optional fields still make the composed shape
 * visibly converge toward `Ports` for consumers that do need them.
