 * @remarks
 * The mapping is total and preserves the measurement-owned `stopReason`.
 * `no-changes-needed` is always `'settled'` because its loop never starts.
 * A row without a commit capability retains `no-artifact-change`; in
 * particular, an unresolved row that reached Stage 3 can retain either
 * `'settled'` or `'attempt-limit'` without being reclassified by settlement.
 * A batch-level confirmation for other rows has no effect on these rows:
 *
 * | Measured repair outcome | Per-case settlement | Application |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | no commit capability | absent | `no-artifact-change` |
 *
 * For every commit-capable `healed` or `partially-healed` row, the remaining
 * confirmation and settlement combinations are exhaustive:
 *
 * | Confirmation | `dryRun` | Per-case settlement | Application |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `not-required` | `true` | absent | `preview-only` |
 * | `authorized` | `false` | `committed` | `applied` |
 * | `authorized` | `false` | `failed`, `partiallyWritten` empty | `apply-failed` |
 * | `authorized` | `false` | `failed`, `partiallyWritten` non-empty | `partially-applied` |
 * | `declined` | `false` | absent | `declined` |
 * | `interrupted` | `false` | absent | `not-applied-interrupted` |
 *
 * The function throws `UnexpectedCrashError` for every omitted combination:
 * a settlement for `no-changes-needed`, `unresolved`, preview-only, declined,
 * or interrupted; `not-required` with `dryRun: false`; any non-
 * `not-required` confirmation with `dryRun: true`; a missing, duplicate, or
 * wrong-case settlement for an authorized commit-capable row; or an untyped
 * settlement result. The explicit `dryRun` argument distinguishes preview-only
 * from the invalid non-dry-run no-settlement state; confirmation and
 * settlement count alone cannot do so. Confirmation interruption is ORed into
 * the settled batch interruption flag because `heal()` returned before the
 * terminal exchange began. Failed commits retain their rows and add matching
 * case-scoped errors without collapsing an integrity refusal into an
 * execution-environment failure: integrity failures remain
 * `INTEGRITY_VIOLATION`, while genuine persistence failures remain
 * `FS_IO_ERROR`. The error itself must carry `details.partiallyWritten` from
 * its `HealCommitOutcome`, because report mapping reads the error details
 * rather than the settlement wrapper. Other structured details from the
 * underlying classified error remain available, while the outcome's
 * partial-write evidence authoritatively replaces any stale value carried by
 * that error.

/**
 * Runs the composed healing command and produces its final report result.
 *
 * @param input - Parsed command arguments, working directory, and cancellation.
 * @returns A structured envelope and its selected process exit code.
 * @remarks
 * This composition has one deliberately ordered path. `heal()` owns
 * the early `--list` selection result, so this runtime lets it short-circuit
 * before consulting `ci.heal`; the shared list contract promises discovery
 * without a primary effect and an exit-zero result even when CI healing is
 * disabled. Only a real attempt reaches the `deps.config.ci.heal` refusal
 * gate, then `heal()` measures every case against its private overlay and
 * returns both its outcome and pending commit capabilities. Confirmation must
 * follow that measurement because no earlier boundary can truthfully describe
 * the files and repair kinds pending writes, yet it remains before the
 * first capability invocation so no real artifact write precedes consent.
 *
 * An empty `result.commits` map has no artifact write to authorize, so it
 * skips confirmation in every execution environment.
 *
 * A dry run never prompts and never invokes `commit()`, irrespective of
 * `--yes` or `-y`: it reports pending eligible repairs as preview-only while
 * leaving their buffered artifact changes unapplied. The two flag forms are
 * the same pre-authorization. Without either form, a non-interactive
 * caller receives the exit-2 refusal rather than a hidden prompt or implicit
 * write. Interactivity is supplied by the `isInteractive()`/
 * `createTtyInteractivityCheck` seam, not an inline
 * `process.stderr.isTTY` observation, so runtime tests can provide the host
 * fact deterministically and command policy remains independent of Node's
 * process-global state. The same internal composition constructs the
 * confirmation-answer reader
 * before delegating an interactive exchange to the confirmation policy.
 *
 * Cancellation covers the entire invocation rather than only healing. Before
 * an interactive confirmation has obtained consent, including while its yes/no
 * question is pending, no commit capability is called. If cancellation arrives
 * after case processing but before that prompt, the same zero-write outcome
 * preserves already-computed results and skipped identities. With
 * `--yes`/`-y`, authorization predates case processing, so that timing commits
 * exactly the already-terminal cases represented in `result.commits`; cases
 * marked skipped never acquire a capability. Once authorized commit settlement
 * has begun, every eligible capability settles, and a failed case cannot
 * prevent later independent commits; cancellation cannot rewrite an
 * already-started storage settlement into a different batch result.
 *
 * After authorized capabilities settle, this boundary first reconciles
 * failed commits, builds one candidate, and passes it through the shared
 * finalizer. Building after settlement prevents an initial report from
 * becoming stale and keeps a failed commit case-scoped; finalization then
 * rounds executed heal-case durations, normalizes the public identities, and
 * recomputes summary from the settled facts. The emergency singleton from
 * that shared boundary alone selects exit code 3, so every other semantic
 * exit code remains the report builder's decision.
