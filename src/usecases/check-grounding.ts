 * the caller already owns the CheckFileError path for I/O failures and must

/**
 * Classifies the grounding companion associated with one plan.

 * @param storage - Read-only storage whose no-write contract is an invariant
 * of check's design: grounding inspection must never acquire authority to
 * create, replace, or otherwise mutate storage.
 * @param groundingPath - Opaque path of the companion artifact to inspect.
 * @param plan - The parsed plan whose digest the companion is compared
 * against.
 * @returns The companion's absence, validity, or relationship to `plan`.
 * @throws Propagates a storage rejection while reading an existing companion,
 * so the caller can preserve it as a per-file I/O error.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The helper returns only a classification because its caller
 * owns report-status selection; parsed content and parse diagnostics do not
 * cross that boundary. A named read port also keeps this check-closure helper
 * consistent with its parent use case instead of encoding the same capability
 * as an ad hoc structural `Pick`. Digest equality is the provenance gate for
 * coverage inspection: a document for another plan remains stale without
 * canonical scanning, because its bytes cannot establish usable current
 * grounding. The raw scan is caught here so malformed artifact structure is
 * classified as invalid rather than escaping into the caller's storage-I/O
 * error path. Once a claim is found, the shared canonicality primitive already
 * converts a serialization failure into an invalid result, so a second local
 * exception boundary would only duplicate and risk weakening that contract.
