 * reclassification.
 * @throws {import('#core/errors/prompt-path-invalid-error.js').PromptPathInvalidError} When a selected path is ineligible before per-file work begins.
 * @remarks
 * The shared core resolver treats an explicit target as a caller-supplied
 * validity requirement, so an invalid explicit name resolves before discovery
 * and throws its classified failure at this command boundary without fallback.
 * When the selected-file set is non-empty, implicit selection runs once before
 * per-file work and applies the loader-validated default followed by the sole
 * enumerable own target. With zero selected files, that resolution is skipped,
 * allowing an orphan-only scan to avoid an unrelated target ambiguity.
 * Selected files are sequential so a case-scoped storage failure leaves later
 * selections inspectable. Their occurrence-qualified scheduling keys are
 * `selected:<index>:<file>`; plan and grounding candidates use
 * `plan:<index>:<artifact-path>` and
 * `grounding:<index>:<artifact-path>`. These keys preserve duplicate
 * occurrence rows and keep plan and grounding findings independently terminal
 * even when they derive the same public test identity.
 *
 * After each plan or grounding discovery call resolves, the usecase
 * inverse-maps every valid returned element and registers that whole response
 * in order before evaluating the interruption latch. Each registered work key
 * becomes terminal when its `exists(testPath)` inspection completes, including
 * the healthy no-finding case that emits no result or case error. Pending
 * public identities retain first-seen work order and are deduplicated only for
 * skipped-row emission; a terminal sibling row with the same identity remains
 * visible.
 *
 * Only a latched interruption suppresses a later phase. A raw aborted signal
 * with no known pending work permits the next discovery phase, so an empty plan
 * response cannot hide grounding-only work. Once pending plan work latches
 * interruption, grounding discovery and all later storage calls are
 * suppressed. The listener is disposed in `finally` after both normal
 * completion and rejection.
 *
 * Freshness accepts only canonical plans whose digest reflects the normalized
 * prompt and the resolved target. Grounding content is deliberately excluded:
 * it is a recoverable replay cache rather than a freshness input. `--list`
 * handling ends immediately after selection, before implicit target
 * resolution or any inspection phase, so even an empty listing succeeds
 * without relying on the ordinary zero-match path.
 *
 * Artifact detection remains a whole-tree integrity invariant, independent of
 * literal selection and selected-file outcomes. Each scan enumerates by
 * its fixed suffix without applying configured ignores, then inverse-derive a
 * virtual test path and judge that path against `testMatch` and `testIgnore`.
 * An inverse-incapable artifact becomes an `invalid-artifact-name` finding in
 * `orphanFindings`, which preserves the existing zero-match formula and puts
 * it before that phase's later orphan findings. The registration and terminal
 * loops remain separate so the batch tracker still knows the whole discovered
 * phase before asynchronous existence checks begin. Stable ordering follows
 * selected findings with plans before grounding. Orphan grounding findings
 * place the artifact path only in `groundingFile` and use the exact path-free reason
 * `No corresponding test file exists for this grounding artifact.`, so free
 * text cannot disclose a host path. These boundaries preserve shared exit
 * priority between integrity findings, case errors, interruption, and genuine
 * zero matches.
