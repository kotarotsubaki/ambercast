/**
 * Builds the report and exit status for one completed or failed generation command.
 *
 * @param input - Outcome or error together with timing and reporting policy.
 * @returns A complete generate report paired with its process exit code.
 * @remarks
 * This helper owns only serializable reporting policy. It uses the shared
 * report-version constant and delegates accounting to the identity-set
 * summarizer after results and case errors are assembled. `generated`,
 * `would-generate`, and `skipped-fresh` rows classify as passed; failed rows classify as
 * failed unless a matching case error promotes the same identity to errored;
 * listed and interruption-skipped rows classify as skipped. Duplicate rows and
 * result/error pairs never inflate `total`.
 *
 * Every failed file becomes one case-scoped `ReportError` whose `caseId` is
 * the file path. The error-kind correspondence selects its usage or
 * environment kind and stable report code. A top-level `AmbercastError`, such
 * as a configuration-load or provider-resolution failure before file work,
 * instead becomes one run-scoped error with an empty result list.
 *
 * A top-level thrown error retains its own exit code because no completed batch
 * exists and its empty result set yields an all-zero shared summary. For a
 * completed batch, this builder contributes every applicable
 * code to `selectExitCode()`: failures contribute their classified code or the
 * generic exit-3 fallback when malformed input supplies no classification, and
 * strict ambiguities contribute exit 1. The shared 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 0 order then
 * selects the highest-priority condition across the batch, independent of
 * file order.
 *
 * When the completed outcome is interrupted, the builder appends exactly one
 * run-scoped `INTERRUPTED` environment error and contributes exit 3. The error
 * has no `caseId`, so it does not change case counts; a higher-priority exit 2
 * condition still wins through the common selector.
 *
 * A disallowed zero-match condition contributes exit 5 to that same list,
 * instead of returning early. The normal zero-match outcome has no results,
 * but representing it as a candidate also makes malformed yet type-valid
 * outcomes obey the one common priority policy when another condition is
 * present. `allowEmpty` and `list` still decide whether zero matches count as
 * a failure; they do not decide how it ranks. The zero-match envelope is
 * error-free with an all-zero summary.
