   * `executeAgentic` call first re-checks the deadline. A dispatch attempted
   * after that deadline denies the phase even when the phase started before
   * it, which is why the deadline is checked both at phase start and per
   * dispatch. Only while the deadline still permits it does an `incremental`
   * phase check its remaining dispatch allowance and charge one unit. A
   * `stage3` phase skips that allowance check entirely: it is deadline-gated
   * only and is never denied for reaching the dispatch limit. One denied
   * dispatch latches the entire phase as denied, discarding both `work`'s
   * value and any ordinary error it threw. Every `IntegrityViolationError`
   * thrown by `work`, exact class or subclass, instead produces an
   * `integrity-failure` outcome regardless of the denial state. Embedded
   * integrity failures remain caller-specific values, so callers convert them
   * to thrown errors before `work` settles when they require this arbitration.
   * The controller inspects only a failed result's error, never a successful
   * result's value.
   *
   * After `work` settles, the controller gives its own first-latched protocol
   * violation priority, then turns an unconsumed `ai-call` into and latches a
   * fresh protocol violation. It next returns a thrown
   * `IntegrityViolationError`, then a latched denial, and otherwise completes
   * the phase. This order keeps phase-local protocol integrity ahead of
   * integrity and denial arbitration even when an intermediate caller catches
   * the original error. Deferred Stage 2 rejection events are never flushed
   * on any of the first four outcomes.
   *
   * A second phase from the same controller is a programming error while the
   * first remains open. The controller throws its reentrancy assertion at
   * entry, before checking the deadline or calling `work`; phases never nest,
   * so `work` must not call `runPhase` again until its own promise settles.

   * `completed` outcome preserves `work`'s success or ordinary failure, a

/**

 * This module defines the module-private, `unique symbol`-branded
 * `DispatchDeniedError`. The decorated `execute` and `executeAgentic` methods
 * throw `DispatchDeniedError` when either phase kind is denied, including
 * Stage 3's deadline-only denial. `runPhase` catches and consumes it
 * internally to produce the phase's final `deniedReason`; it never escapes
 * `runPhase` to any caller. It is a defense-in-depth leak detector, not a
 * report error, and callers such as `heal.ts` must never inspect it.
 *
 * The phase-local event proxy keeps each caller-owned `ai-call` pending until
 * its dispatch is admitted, defers `heal-stage2-rejected` until the phase
 * settles, and suppresses the matching `ai-result` after a denial. The latter
 * closes the caller-owned `finally` path without publishing a result for an
 * unadmitted dispatch. It records denied call IDs on the per-phase record and checks that
 * record's identity against `openPhase`, so a proxy retained beyond settlement
 * cannot affect a later phase. All other events pass through unchanged. After
 * work settles, its own first-latched protocol
 * violation rejects first; an unconsumed pending `ai-call` becomes and
 * latches a fresh protocol violation next; a thrown
 * `IntegrityViolationError` follows; a latched denial follows that; and all
 * remaining work completes. Protocol integrity must win over integrity and
 * denial arbitration, so deferred Stage 2 rejection events are never flushed
 * on any of those first four outcomes. Only a successful completed phase
 * flushes one deferred `heal-stage2-rejected` event, preventing invalid or
 * unsuccessful work from publishing it to the real sink.
 *
 * @param params - Case-local inputs for the controller.
 * @param params.resolveAiExecutor - The case's own unresolved, unbound lazy
 * resolver. It retains the `(signal?) => Promise<...>` shape that `run()`
 * expects, allowing the controller to avoid provider resolution unless an
 * admitted phase actually needs it.
 * @param params.signal - The case `AbortSignal`, passed unchanged to the real
 * resolver so cancellation during provider resolution or probing is retained.
 * @param params.clock - The monotonic clock used for all phase and dispatch
 * deadline checks in this case.
 * @param params.events - The real event sink behind each phase-local proxy.
 * @param params.deadlineMs - The case-wide deadline computed once by the
 * caller, rather than a fresh deadline per phase.
 * @param params.maxDispatches - The incremental dispatch allowance: `Infinity`
 * when `heal.maxStepRepairs` is unset, otherwise a finite positive integer
 * validated when the controller is constructed.
