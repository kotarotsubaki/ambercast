/**
 * Builds the JSON-safe, data-only context for one Stage 2 provider request.
 *
 * The builder derives duplicated fields only from the paired current plan
 * and replay measurement, preserving a single attribution source for the
 * frontier. It retains case-start failure evidence from `baseline` while
 * attributing current failure evidence and the current plan to `current`.
 * A failure index outside a plan's step range omits `failingStep` entirely,
 * rather than serialize it as `null`.
 *
 * The builder is the JsonValueT compatibility boundary: callers receive a
 * JSON-safe value and must not add an unchecked cast. Its provenance split is
 * not an authority split; all values remain data under the prompt envelope's
 * existing instruction-resistant framing. It carries the already-derived
 * allowlist projection only under `trustedInputs`, preserving the distinction
 * between provider choice, fixed committed reservations, and execution policy
 * required by Stage 2 (SPEC-C3-2).
 *
 * @remarks
 * `currentPlan` is constructed by explicitly enumerating `schemaVersion`,
 * `source`, `targets`, and `steps`; it must not spread the plan object. This
 * structurally excludes `generatorMeta`, including if the plan schema gains
 * additional fields later. The builder also snapshots `repairHistory` before
 * placing it in the context, so later caller mutations such as `.push()`
 * cannot retroactively alter an already-built context.
 *
 * @param params - The normalized prompt, paired baseline and current replay
 * measurements, and adopted repair history for this repair request.
 * @returns The JSON-safe, provenance-separated context for a Stage 2 provider
 * request.
