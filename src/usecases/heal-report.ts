/**
 * Builds the report and exit status for one completed or failed heal command.

 * @returns A complete heal report paired with its process exit code.
 * @remarks
 * This pure boundary translates only reportable facts. Completed case outcomes
 * become execution-backed heal rows; `listed` and `skipped` discovery
 * identities become identity-only rows; and case errors become case-scoped
 * envelope errors so the shared summarizer can account for a result/error
 * identity once. An interrupted batch appends exactly one run-scoped
 * `INTERRUPTED` error, making the stop observable without creating a case
 * identity.
 *
 * Exit candidates are collected rather than encoded in a heal-specific
 * precedence branch: each case error contributes its own exit code,
 * `partially-healed` and `unresolved` repair outcomes remain failure
 * candidates regardless of application, while declined application adds an
 * independent failure candidate. This preserves incomplete-repair failures
 * instead of replacing them with a persistence-only rule. `stage3Error` plus
 * `finalReplayError` contribute their
 * classified candidates. The shared selector then resolves their established
 * priority, as run reporting does for a result's attached error. The usual
 * disallowed empty selection and interruption candidates are added alongside
 * them. Progress indices, buffered overlays, and commit capabilities remain
 * internal so a report cannot imply that an unconfirmed candidate was
 * persisted. Command composition normalizes elapsed duration with
 * `Math.max(0, Math.round(...))` before this boundary, matching other command
 * reports. It passes the command-normalized integer duration through unchanged.
