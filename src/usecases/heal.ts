 *
 * @remarks
 * The repair phase iterates one frontier at a time. A visited-frontier set
 * records every non-sentinel frontier before Stage 1 so a replay that regresses
 * to an earlier index cannot dispatch work there again. Each iteration uses
 * its retained measurement, runs Stage 1, and runs Stage 2 only when Stage 1
 * does not advance the frontier. The deadline is checked both at phase entry,
 * where it can deny even a non-dispatching recovery, and immediately before
 * every real dispatch inside an admitted phase; the attempt ceiling applies
 * only to chargeable dispatches within an admitted incremental phase. A failed,
 * discarded, exhausted, or revisited
 * incremental path enters Stage 3, whose unsuccessful full-plan replay
 * restores the best pre-Stage-3 incremental candidate. The resulting full
 * pass, resource-bound, and Stage-3 states are classified from the retained
 * measurement and stop reason, keeping measured progress separate from why
 * iteration stopped.
 *
 * Each status switch is deliberately limited to status arbitration and value
 * extraction. Because a switch is itself a break target, placing repair-loop
 * exit control in a case would silently keep the repair loop running instead
 * of stopping it. The two arbitration points nested in the repair loop
 * therefore use `break repairLoop`; an unlabeled `break` there would be
 * consumed by the switch.
