/**
 * A report envelope that has crossed the command-report finalization boundary.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The brand follows the co-located `NormalizedTestMd` precedent: it makes the
 * boundary visible to TypeScript without changing the object at runtime. It
 * deliberately covers every command branch because validation failure always
 * returns the run-shaped emergency envelope, including for non-run callers.
 * As with that precedent, spreads can lose or recreate the brand in type
 * space, so it is a contract for producers and consumers rather than
 * immutability.

/**
 * Finalizes a raw command report for every public consumer.
 *
 * @param raw - The unfinalized envelope built by a command report producer.
 * @param projectRoot - The root that defines portable path containment.
 * @returns The branded envelope accepted by command outputs and CLI rendering.
 * @remarks
 * This boundary lives in `usecases/` because it needs core values as well as
 * report contracts; placing it beside report schemas would violate the
 * architecture's value-import boundary while keeping the reporting layer free
 * of forbidden value imports.
 *
 * The pipeline has one fixed order. It rounds per-case `durationMs`
 * with `Math.max(0, Math.round(value))` only for executed `run` and `heal`
 * result rows, and removes a screenshot that cannot be represented as a
 * project-contained POSIX relative path instead of representing it as `null`.
 * It then relativizes only `id`, `file`,
 * `planFile`, `caseId`, `groundingFile`, and `artifactFile`. The path-invalid
 * branch also relativizes its optional `details.path`, recomputes the
 * summary from those final identities, and validates the completed candidate.
 * This ordering keeps summaries from observing stale public identities while
 * leaving unexecuted and command-level duration facts intact.
 *
 * Finalization creates a new value rather than mutating `raw`, so applying it
 * again preserves the same visible report. A `safeParse` failure always
 * returns the same frozen emergency-envelope reference, never the invalid
 * candidate or validation details; callers can therefore use identity rather
 * than an unreliable structural match to select the emergency exit policy.
