/**
 * Builds the report and exit status for one completed or failed replay command.
 *
 * @param input - A batch outcome or top-level classified error with timing and
 * the required `allowEmpty`/`list` reporting policy.
 * @returns A complete run envelope paired with its process exit code.
 * @remarks
 * A top-level thrown `AmbercastError` short-circuits immediately with that
 * error's own exit code, just as `buildGenerateReport()` does; it represents a
 * command failure before a case outcome exists. For a completed batch, this
 * builder gives every applicable condition to `selectExitCode()` rather
 * than maintain a report-specific precedence branch. The shared order is 2,
 * then 3, 4, 1, 5, and 0, so a higher-priority outcome wins regardless of
 * where its case appears in the batch.
 *
 * Every envelope built here marks report persistence as `'not-attempted'`.
 * This builder has no visibility into storage, so runtime alone replaces that
 * provisional state after an attempted write. The separation keeps every
 * payload persisted by the command from retaining `'not-attempted'`.
 *
 * Classified case errors contribute their established exit codes. An aborted
 * result without its own classified error contributes the generic exit-3
 * stopgap, and a failed assertion contributes exit 1. The no-tests-found
 * condition contributes exit 5 only when neither `allowEmpty` nor list mode
 * makes the empty selection intentional. The abort rule is deliberately
 * scoped to each result rather than the whole batch. A classified exit-4
 * error can also have an error status, and treating every error status as a
 * batch-wide exit-3 condition would manufacture a higher-priority code that
 * misreports that classified failure. The stopgap exists because grounding
 * misses, unsupported run references, and unclassified browser-session
 * errors have no suitable reserved `ErrorKind`, yet a batch containing only
 * those aborts must not appear successful.
 *
 * The builder uses the shared report-version constant and identity-set
 * summarizer. Passed execution rows classify as passed, failed assertions as
 * failed, execution errors and matching case errors as errored, and listed or
 * interruption-skipped identities as skipped. Duplicate identities and a
 * result/error pair contribute once to `total`; run-scoped errors never enter
 * case accounting. Listed and skipped rows enter the envelope separately from
 * case outcomes, preserving the evidence requirements of execution-backed
 * results.
 *
 * An interrupted outcome appends exactly one run-scoped `INTERRUPTED`
 * environment error and contributes exit 3 without a `caseId`. This batch fact
 * does not replace terminal case evidence or the existing unclassified
 * case-abort fallback, and the shared selector preserves every higher-priority
 * condition. A command-level error has no results and therefore retains an
 * all-zero shared summary.
