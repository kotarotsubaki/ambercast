/**
 * Defines the declarative architecture and determinism policy translated by
 * dependency-cruiser and ESLint. One policy table gives those tools and their
 * fixture tests the same authored layer data, rather than requiring separate
 * manually maintained tables; each translation still checks only the syntax
 * forms or statically resolvable edges its tool supports.
 *
 * The policy is tooling, not product code, so it remains outside `src/` and
 * is never bundled. It covers the eight product layers plus the `public-entry`,
 * `build-tools`, and `global-types` non-product roles. Together, the eleven
 * roles fully classify `src/**`, including the exact `src/global.d.ts`
 * declaration-file path. A role matcher may match zero files; fixture tests
 * validate representative edges, while the ESLint suite verifies each current
 * source file maps to one policy role and none is unknown.
 */

/**
 * Maps each source role to its root matcher and internal import contract. The
 * matchers use a path-segment boundary: a root matches the root and
 * its descendants, never a same-prefix sibling. Thus `src/core` covers
 * `src/core/**`, not `src/core-extra/**`; every `src/**` file must have one,
 * and only one, role classification.
 *
 * The eleven roles have these permissions:
 *
 * - `core` is rooted at `src/core` and may import only `core` internally.
 * - `ports` is rooted at `src/ports` and may import `ports` plus `core` only
 *   through a type-only edge. Its port-module file descriptor captures the
 *   basename as `family`, allowing an adapter family to target only its own
 *   interface file.
 * - `adapters` has mutually exclusive standard and HTTP matchers. The
 *   standard matcher is rooted at `src/adapters/<family>/` and explicitly
 *   excludes the `http` family; it may import `core`, its own adapter family,
 *   and its implemented port module. By convention, that module has the same
 *   base file name as the adapter family: `adapters/storage/**` may import
 *   `ports/storage.ts`, but not `ports/ai.ts` or a different family's port
 *   module. A flat module directly below `src/adapters/` is instead an
 *   `adapters-root-file` fallback with no import permissions: it is malformed
 *   for the family convention, so the safest contract prevents its filename
 *   from becoming a fictitious family. Its `externalAllow` entry is a closed
 *   dependency list because standard adapters are the layer with concrete
 *   external integrations: browser automation, filesystem access, subprocess
 *   execution, and third-party validation libraries. Adapters joins core in
 *   having a closed external-dependency contract; the remaining product roles
 *   (`ports`, `usecases`, `report`, `config`, `runtime`, and `cli`) currently
 *   have none because none imports anything external today. This closed
 *   allowlist applies to that matcher only,
 *   not to the `adapters-http` carve-out, which remains outside this
 *   enforcement. An unrestricted standard-adapter external surface would be
 *   a live enforcement gap. The specialized `src/adapters/http` matcher may
 *   import `runtime` only. The standard adapter policy compares the captured
 *   adapter and port families, and fixture tests exercise that convention
 *   with synthetic names.
 * - `usecases` is rooted at `src/usecases` and may import `core`, `usecases`,
 *   and `report`, plus `ports` through a type-only edge.
 * - `report` is rooted at `src/report` and may import `report` plus `core`
 *   through a type-only edge.
 * - `config` is rooted at `src/config` and may import `config` and `core`.
 *   Its `ports` approximation forbids value imports and allows type-only
 *   imports from any ports module. Dependency-cruiser's available conditions
 *   cannot narrow that type-only exemption to the `Storage` type by symbol.
 * - `runtime` is rooted at `src/runtime` and may import `core`, `ports`,
 *   `usecases`, `config`, `runtime`, and concrete `adapters/**` other than
 *   `adapters/http`; it is the composition point for those concrete adapters.
 * - `cli` is rooted at `src/cli` and may import `runtime` only.
 * - `public-entry` is the exact file `src/index.ts`, classified by a file
 *   category rather than a folder element. It has no default product-layer
 *   target; a public API target, when needed, is an explicit allowance rather
 *   than a catch-all inherited permission.
 * - `build-tools` is rooted at `src/build-tools`; it may import `core`,
 *   `report`, and `config`, and has the separate external allowance of
 *   `node:fs`, `node:path`, and `node:url`, rather than inheriting core's
 *   external permission. Its schema-artifact generator imports `report` for
 *   the report-owned JSON Schema getter and `config` to project
 *   `DEFAULT_RAW_CONFIG` into a published defaults artifact. Those remain
 *   narrow, single-purpose edges; no other build tool needs either
 *   cross-layer permission.
 * - `global-types` is the exact file `src/global.d.ts`, also classified by a
 *   file category. Its ambient `declare const` declarations have no import
 *   permissions because a global declaration file cannot contain runtime
 *   imports.
 *
 * The standard adapter path excludes HTTP, keeping it non-overlapping with
 * the specialized HTTP role and preventing either direction of a
 * `runtime`/HTTP-adapter cycle from being treated as a generic adapter
 * permission.
 *
 * Cross-layer aliases mirror legal import targets only. There is no `#cli/*`
 * alias because no role may use CLI as a cross-layer target.
